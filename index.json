The system generates a fingerprint for each package by first isolating the package via background removal and then generating features through a color histogram, dimensions of the package and a contrastive encoder. These fingerprints can then be used to match images to package, as 2 images of the same package will have a similar fingerprint.

Our approach conducts interventions using internal models, which are simulations with approximate dynamics and simplified assumptions. These interventions elicit the structure between the state and action spaces, enabling construction of neural network policies with only relevant states as input. These policies are pretrained using the internal model with domain randomization over the relevant states. The policy network weights are then transferred to the target domain (e.g., the real world) for fine tuning. We perform extensive policy transfer experiments in simulation for two representative manipulation tasks: block stacking and crate opening. Our policies are shown to be more robust to domain shifts, more sample efficient to learn, and scale to more complex settings with larger state spaces. We also show improved zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of our policies for the block stacking task.","tags":[],"title":"Causal Reasoning in Simulation for Structure and Transfer Learning of Robot Manipulation Policies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Optimial Vaccine Distribution amongst countries suffering Covid-19 can be a challenging as countries with more cases need more vaccines while those with less cases need less vaccines. We implemented models to model the growth of Covid-19 in country using the SIRD model which is based on continous markov decision processes. Then we implemented a reinforcmenent learning agent that can choose the optimial vaccine distribution policy between countries per day depending on some fixed supply of vaccines to minimize total number of deaths between a chosen set of countries. Our agent is able to learn better policies than naive methods such as distributing vaccines based on the ratio of cases or a countries population, as it is able to understand how the cases in a country will change overtime. We implemented a webapp based on Heryoku and Figma to allow users to select their own scenarios of which countries to consider and train an agent to learn a policy for that.\nThis project was implemented in 24 hours and won best use of google cloud for CuHacking.\n","date":1612051200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612051200,"objectID":"2d3235472ef21d6f61ae7ea3bf03f6d0","permalink":"https://siddharthgir.github.io/project/covid_rl/","publishdate":"2021-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/covid_rl/","section":"project","summary":"Modelling Covid-19 growth and finding optimial vaccine distribution between countries","tags":["Deep Learning","Reinforcement Learning"],"title":"Guide Vaccine","type":"project"},{"authors":["Benjamin A.

As anticipatory assistance is provided before help is explicitly requested, there is a chance that this action itself will influence the person’s future decisions in the task. In this work, we investigate whether a robot’s anticipatory assistance can drive people to make choices different from those they would otherwise make. Such a study requires measuring intent, which itself could modify intent, resulting in an observer paradox. To combat this, we carefully designed an experiment to avoid this effect. We considered several mitigations such as the careful choice of which human behavioral signals we use to measure intent and designing unobtrusive ways to obtain these signals. We conducted a user study (N= 99) in which participants completed a collaborative object retrieval task: users selected an object and a robot arm retrieved it for them. The robot predicted the user’s object selection from eye gaze in advance of their explicit selection, and then provided either collaborative anticipation (moving toward the predicted object), adversarial anticipation (moving away from the predicted object), or no anticipation (nomovement, control condition). We found trends and participant comments suggesting people’s decision making changes in the presence of a robot anticipatory motion and this change differs depending on the robot’s anticipation strategy.","tags":[],"title":"Examining the Effects of Anticipatory Robot Assistance on Human Decision Making","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579478400,"objectID":"c63b281245275dc38923b290219914ef","permalink":"https://siddharthgir.github.io/project/whac/","publishdate":"2020-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/whac/","section":"project","summary":"Autonomous indoor navigation with a small mobile robot","tags":["SLAM","Robotics","ROS","Motion Planning"],"title":"WHAC","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ada Taylor","Roman Kaufmann","Siddharth Girdhar","Henny Admoni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"44b445ef3734962645ca0ced5b7e5398","permalink":"https://siddharthgir.github.io/publication/food-workshop/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/food-workshop/","section":"publication","summary":"The goal of this work is to train a model to quantify mental states such as neediness and interruptibility from human action patterns in restaurant scenarios. Our long-term vision is to develop robot waiters that can intelligently respond to customers. Our key insight is that human behaviors can both actively and passively communicate customers’ underlying mental states. To interpret behaviors indicating neediness and interruptibility, we automatically label key moments of human service patterns in restaurants based on waiter location and objects, as well as human behavior patterns in terms of pose, facial expression, and facial action units. Our effort to build a model is complicated by a lack of ground truth information, unreliability in waiter actions, and the effect of distractions and non-service social interactions on customer signals, and we propose solutions to each of these issues. We plan to compare the performance of several machine learning methods in predicting moments when waiters attend to customer needs based on this model.","tags":[],"title":"Modeling human need for attention and interruptibility in restaurant scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
